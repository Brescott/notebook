#warning: tempnam() has been disabled for security reasons

环境 centos6.5+php7.0.19

在做数据导出的时候，php报错如下：
warning: tempnam() has been disabled for security reasons

# warning: tempnam() has been disabled for security reasons in /home/mysite/public_html/ar/includes/file.inc on line 772.
# warning: fopen() [function.fopen]: Filename cannot be empty in /home/mysite/public_html/ar/includes/file.inc on line 773.
# The file could not be created.
# warning: tempnam() has been disabled for security reasons in /home/mysitre/public_html/ar/includes/file.inc on line 772.
# warning: fopen() [function.fopen]: Filename cannot be empty in /home/mysite/public_html/ar/includes/file.inc on line 773.
# The file could not be created


类似这种报错，查看php.ini是否禁用了tempnam函数，如果是的话把disable_functions里面的tempname函数名删除，
并重启php服务
systemctl restart php-fpm7.service
